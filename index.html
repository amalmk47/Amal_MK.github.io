      <h3>Bilingual Image Captioning in English and Malayalam Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Large Language Model</h3>
      <p>Developed a bilingual image captioning system that generates descriptive sentences in both English and Malayalam using deep learning. Utilized a ResNet-18 encoder to extract image features and a Transformer decoder for language generation. The dataset used was Malayalam Visual Genome 1.0, consisting of over 29,000 images annotated in both languages. Applied greedy decoding for inference, and trained the model using CrossEntropy loss while optimizing with the Adam optimizer. Performance was rigorously evaluated using BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE-L scores, demonstrating the modelâ€™s effectiveness in capturing multilingual semantics. This project showcases the integration of computer vision and NLP in a multilingual setting.</p>

      <h3>Predicting Electric Vehicle Energy Consumption using TabTransformer, TabNet, and BERT-Enhanced Models</h3>
      <p>Built advanced predictive models to forecast electric vehicle (EV) energy consumption using deep learning and hybrid feature engineering techniques. Implemented TabTransformer and TabNet architectures for handling structured tabular data, incorporating BERT embeddings for text features. Performed Bayesian Optimization with Optuna to fine-tune model hyperparameters and reduce Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to 0.38. Achieved a 20% boost in prediction accuracy through LightGBM modeling and unsupervised clustering techniques. This project emphasizes scalable green-tech solutions in data-driven energy efficiency, focusing on the intersection of NLP, deep learning, and sustainability.</p>
